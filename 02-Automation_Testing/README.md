# 2. Automation Testing 

## üìå Overview  
This section demonstrates my ability to design, implement, and document **test automation frameworks** using a combination of code-based and codeless tools.  

Instead of leaving only raw scripts and configuration files, I‚Äôve included **well-documented examples, structured frameworks, and clear instructions**, making it easy for technical and non-technical readers to see how I automate tests, structure frameworks, and produce maintainable solutions.

## üí° Why I Included This  
Automation is essential for modern QA teams, so testers must be able to:  
1. Build scalable, maintainable, and reusable automated test scripts  
2. Combine programming, database, and framework knowledge to test end-to-end scenarios  
3. Integrate automation with CI/CD pipelines and reporting to deliver actionable results  

This repository shows that I can implement **professional-grade automation frameworks** using industry-standard tools and practices.
