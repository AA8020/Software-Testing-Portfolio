# TestNG â€“ Test Framework for Automation

## ðŸ“Œ Overview  
This folder demonstrates my skills in using **TestNG** to structure, manage, and execute automated tests.  
It includes examples of annotations, test suites, data-driven testing, parallel execution, and reporting for maintainable automation frameworks.

---

## ðŸ’¡ Why I Included This  
TestNG is essential for **professional automation testing**:  
1. Organize tests into **suites and groups** for better management  
2. Execute tests **in parallel** to save time  
3. Generate **detailed, structured reports** for stakeholders  
4. Support **data-driven and reusable test scenarios**  

This folder shows that I can **leverage TestNG features** to make automation efficient and maintainable.

## ðŸŽ¯ Knowledge Demonstrated  
- TestNG annotations: `@Test`, `@BeforeMethod`, `@AfterMethod`, `@BeforeClass`, `@AfterClass`  
- Data providers for **parameterized testing**  
- Test priorities and grouping for organized execution  
- Parallel test execution for efficiency  
- Listeners for **custom logging and reporting**  
- Integration with **Selenium WebDriver and Java scripts**

## ðŸ“Œ How to Navigate  

### 1. Annotations (`/01-Annotations`)  
- **Focus**: Understanding core TestNG annotations  
- **What you will find**:  
  - Examples of `@Test`, `@BeforeMethod`, `@AfterMethod`, `@BeforeClass`, `@AfterClass`  
  - Sample scripts showing execution order  

### 2. Data Providers (`/02-DataProviders`)  
- **Focus**: Parameterized and data-driven tests  
- **What you will find**:  
  - Examples using `@DataProvider` to run tests with multiple inputs  
  - Integration with Selenium WebDriver scripts  

### 3. Priorities and Execution (`/03-Priorities_And_Execution`)  
- **Focus**: Controlling test execution order  
- **What you will find**:  
  - Scripts demonstrating test priorities and grouping  
  - Parallel execution examples  

### 4. Reports and Listeners (`/04-Reports_And_Listeners`)  
- **Focus**: Custom logging and structured reporting  
- **What you will find**:  
  - TestNG HTML reports and logs  
  - Custom listeners for screenshots and result tracking

## ðŸ“‚ Key Artifacts  
1. **TestNG Scripts** â€“ Structured examples with annotations and priorities  
2. **Data Provider Scripts** â€“ Parameterized test cases  
3. **Reports & Logs** â€“ HTML reports, screenshots, and listener outputs
