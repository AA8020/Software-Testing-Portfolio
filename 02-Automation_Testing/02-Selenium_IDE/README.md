# Selenium IDE â€“ Codeless Test Automation

## ðŸ“Œ Overview  
This folder demonstrates my ability to use **Selenium IDE** for quick, **codeless automation** of web workflows.  
It includes recorded tests, reusable flows, and examples of integrating codeless scripts with code-based frameworks.

---

## ðŸ’¡ Why I Included This  
Selenium IDE is useful for **fast test creation** and **smoke/regression testing**:  
1. Record and playback tests without coding knowledge  
2. Quickly create reusable test flows for repetitive checks  
3. Export recorded scripts to a Java-based Browser Automation Framework (Selenium WebDriver) for advanced customization  

This folder shows that I can **leverage codeless automation** alongside traditional frameworks to speed up testing while maintaining quality.

## ðŸŽ¯ Knowledge Demonstrated  
- Recording web workflows and actions  
-- Exporting scripts to **Java + a Java-based Browser Automation Framework (Selenium WebDriver)**  
- Creating **modular, reusable test flows**  
- Handling simple assertions, verifications, and navigation steps  

---

## ðŸ“Œ How to Navigate  

### 1. Recorded Scripts (`/01-Recorded_Scripts`)  
- **Focus**: Basic recorded test cases  
- **What you will find**:  
  - Recorded workflows for login, forms, and navigation  
  - Step-by-step playback with validation points  

### 2. Codeless Flows (`/02-Codeless_Flows`)  
- **Focus**: Modular test flows without coding  
- **What you will find**:  
  - Modular action commands for reuse across tests  
  - Smoke and regression examples  

### 3. Exported to WebDriver (`/03-Exported_To_WebDriver`)  
- **Focus**: Combining codeless and code-based automation  
- **What you will find**:  
  - Exported Java + Selenium scripts from Selenium IDE  
  - Integration examples with TestNG or POM structures

## ðŸ“‚ Key Artifacts  
1. **Recorded Test Cases** â€“ Core Selenium IDE recordings  
2. **Codeless Test Flows** â€“ Modular actions for quick automation  
3. **Exported Scripts** â€“ Java + WebDriver integration examples

## ðŸ›  Tools I Used  
- [Selenium IDE](https://www.selenium.dev/selenium-ide/) for codeless automation  
- Java-based Browser Automation Framework (Selenium WebDriver) for exporting and extending scripts  
- [TestNG](https://testng.org/) for structured execution of exported scripts  
- [Java](https://www.java.com/) for coding exported tests
