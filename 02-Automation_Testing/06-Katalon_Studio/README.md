# Katalon Studio â€“ Test Automation

## ðŸ“Œ Overview  
This folder demonstrates my ability to use **Katalon Studio** for **keyword-driven, codeless, and hybrid automation**.  
It includes examples of building reusable test components, integrating with CI/CD, and automating both **web and API workflows**.

---

## ðŸ’¡ Why I Included This  
Katalon Studio is ideal for **efficient test automation** with minimal coding:  
1. Build **keyword-driven tests** for maintainable scripts  
2. Create reusable **components and custom keywords** for modular automation  
3. Integrate automation with **CI/CD pipelines** for continuous testing  
4. Automate **both UI and API workflows** within a single framework  

This folder shows that I can **apply basic-level automation skills** and integrate Katalon tests into professional QA pipelines.
