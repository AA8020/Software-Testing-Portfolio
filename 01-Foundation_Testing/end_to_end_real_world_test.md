# End-to-End Real World Test â€“ OpenCart Demo

This document demonstrates my ability to conduct all major manual test types in a real-world scenario, using the OpenCart demo website. Each test type is applied to realistic user flows and features, showing how a QA professional ensures quality across the entire application lifecycle.

---

## 1. Requirements Review
- Review OpenCart requirements: user registration, product search, checkout, order history, etc.
- Ensure all requirements are clear, complete, and testable.

## 2. Test Case Review
- Peer review all test cases for coverage, clarity, and accuracy before execution.

## 3. Smoke Testing
- Verify homepage loads, user registration, product search, and checkout work after each build or major change.

## 4. Sanity Testing
- Validate critical bug fixes (e.g., login, checkout) and new features before deeper testing.

## 5. Integration Testing
- Test interactions between modules: registration triggers email, cart updates reflect in checkout, payment gateway processes orders.

## 6. System Testing
- Validate end-to-end flows: user journey from registration to order placement and review.

## 7. User Acceptance Testing (UAT)
- Simulate real user scenarios: customer places order, admin manages products, support requests handled.

## 8. Regression Testing
- Re-test login, cart, and order history after bug fixes and enhancements to ensure no old issues reappear.

## 9. Ad-hoc Testing
- Perform random navigation, edge cases, and creative scenarios to uncover hidden issues.

## 10. Usability Testing
- Evaluate navigation, form clarity, mobile responsiveness, and overall user experience.

## 11. Accessibility Testing
- Test screen reader compatibility, keyboard navigation, and color contrast for inclusivity.

## 12. Compatibility Testing
- Test across browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari), OS (Windows, macOS, Linux), and devices (desktop, tablet, mobile).

## 13. Localization Testing
- Switch languages, currencies, and check date/time formats for different regions.

## 14. Internationalization Testing
- Enter non-Latin characters, switch languages, and check UI adaptability for global use.

## 15. Performance Testing (Manual Observation)
- Observe page load times, checkout speed, and stability with multiple concurrent users.

## 16. Confirmation Testing (Re-testing)
- Verify that fixed defects (e.g., login, cart, email) are resolved and functionality works as expected.

## 17. UI/Design Review
- Check for consistent style, accessibility, and responsive design across the site.

## 18. Exploratory Testing
- Actively explore features, filters, and edge cases to uncover hidden issues.

## 19. Error Guessing
- Attempt invalid inputs, rapid submissions, and special character entries to find likely defects.

## 20. Checklist-Based Testing
- Use checklists for homepage, checkout, and account management to ensure no critical area is missed.

## Evidence & Artifacts
- Each test type is documented in its own markdown file, linked in the README for easy reference.
- Defect reports, traceability matrix, and summary report included for full QA lifecycle coverage.

## Conclusion
This end-to-end test demonstrates a holistic, real-world approach to manual testing, applying ISTQB Foundation Level concepts to the OpenCart demo website. All activities are structured to impress recruiters and showcase professional QA skills.
