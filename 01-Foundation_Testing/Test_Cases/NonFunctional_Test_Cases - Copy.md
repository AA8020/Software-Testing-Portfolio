# 01 â€“ Foundation Testing  

## ðŸ“Œ Overview  
This folder demonstrates the **foundations of Quality Assurance and Software Testing** applied on [OpenCart Demo](https://demo.opencart.com/).  
It combines **manual testing basics** with **end-to-end QA practices**, showing how testing integrates into the **SDLC and Agile sprint cycles**.  

---

## ðŸ’¡ Why I Included This  
A **junior QA/tester** is expected to understand not only *how to test* but also *how QA fits into the bigger picture*.  
This folder proves I can:  
- Apply **QA principles** in a real-world context (live demo site)  
- Deliver a **full QA cycle**: from planning â†’ execution â†’ reporting â†’ closure  
- Communicate findings clearly with artifacts that mirror a **real QA sprint environment**  

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Knowledge Demonstrated  
- Understanding the **QA process as a whole** (from planning to reporting)  
- Creating **test plans, test scenarios, test cases, and checklists**  
- Applying **functional and non-functional test types**  
- Writing **bug reports** with severity/priority and clear evidence  
- Building a **requirements traceability matrix (RTM)** to ensure test coverage  
- Using **QA diagrams** (SDLC, V-Model, Test Process) to connect theory with practice  
- Showing how QA fits into the **Agile sprint workflow** (planning â†’ execution â†’ review)  

---

## ðŸ“Œ How to Navigate This Folder  
- Start with [`Test_Plan.md`](./Test_Plan.md) â†’ high-level QA strategy  
- Then check [`Test_Cases.md`](./Test_Cases.md) â†’ detailed test cases with steps and expected results  
- Review [`Bug_Reports.md`](./Bug_Reports.md) â†’ defects logged with screenshots and severity/priority  
- Explore [`Traceability_Matrix.md`](./Traceability_Matrix.md) â†’ mapping requirements to test cases and defects  
- Explore [`Diagrams/`](./Diagrams) â†’ QA lifecycle visuals (SDLC, V-Model, Test Process)

## ðŸ›  Tools I Used  
- **Markdown** for QA documentation  
- **Excel/Google Sheets** for structured test cases, bug tracking, and RTM  
- **Draw.io / Lucidchart** for QA lifecycle diagrams  
- **Screenshots & annotations** for bug reports
