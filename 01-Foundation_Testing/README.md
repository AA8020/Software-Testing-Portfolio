# 01 â€“ Foundation Testing  

## ðŸ“Œ Overview  
This folder demonstrates the **foundations of Quality Assurance and Software Testing** applied on [OpenCart Demo](https://demo.opencart.com/).  
It combines **manual testing basics** with **end-to-end QA practices**, showing how testing integrates into the **SDLC and Agile sprint cycles**.  

---

## ðŸ’¡ Why I Included This  
A **junior QA/tester** is expected to understand not only *how to test* but also *how QA fits into the bigger picture*.  
This folder proves I can:  
- Apply **QA principles** in a real-world context (live demo site)  
- Deliver a **full QA cycle**: from planning â†’ execution â†’ reporting â†’ closure  
- Communicate findings clearly with artifacts that mirror a **real QA sprint environment**  

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Knowledge Demonstrated  
- Understanding the **QA process as a whole** (from planning to reporting)  
- Creating **test plans, test scenarios, test cases, and checklists**  
- Applying **functional and non-functional test types**  
- Writing **bug reports** with severity/priority and clear evidence  
- Building a **requirements traceability matrix (RTM)** to ensure test coverage  
- Performing **risk assessment and test summary reporting**  
- Using **QA diagrams** (SDLC, V-Model, Defect Lifecycle) to connect theory with practice  
- Showing how QA fits into the **Agile sprint workflow** (planning â†’ execution â†’ review)  

## ðŸ“Œ How to Navigate This Folder  

1. **Start with the Overview**  
   - [`README.md`](./README.md) â†’ Understand the folderâ€™s purpose, structure, and high-level approach  

2. **Check Requirements**  
   - [`Requirements.md`](./Requirements.md) â†’ See what features and functionality are assumed for testing  

3. **Review the Test Plan**  
   - [`Test_Plan.md`](./Test_Plan.md) â†’ Learn about QA strategy, scope, roles, environment, and approach  

4. **Look at Test Data**  
   - [`Test_Data.md`](./Test_Data.md) â†’ Reference the input data used for executing test cases  

5. **See Traceability**  
   - [`Traceability_Matrix.md`](./Traceability_Matrix.md) â†’ Understand how requirements map to test cases and defects  

6. **Consider Risks**  
   - [`Risk_Assessment.md`](./Risk_Assessment.md) â†’ Check identified risks, their impact, and mitigation  

7. **Explore Test Cases**  
   - [`Test_Cases/`](./Test_Cases/) â†’ Functional (`Functional_Test_Cases.md`) and non-functional (`NonFunctional_Test_Cases.md`) test cases  

8. **Check Execution Results**  
   - [`Execution/`](./Execution/) â†’ Bug reports (`Bug_Reports.md`) and test execution outcomes (`Test_Execution_Results.md`)  

9. **Use Checklists**  
   - [`Checklists/`](./Checklists/) â†’ Smoke (`Smoke_Checklist.md`) and regression (`Regression_Checklist.md`) checklists for quick verification  

10. **Visualize the Process**  
    - [`Diagrams/`](./Diagrams/) â†’ QA lifecycle diagrams: SDLC, V-Model, Defect Lifecycle  

11. **Finish with Summary**  
    - [`Test_Summary_Report.md`](./Test_Summary_Report.md) â†’ End-of-sprint summary, metrics, and readiness for release
