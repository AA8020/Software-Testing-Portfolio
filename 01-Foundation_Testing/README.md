## Overview
This folder showcases hands-on applications of ISTQB® Foundation Level concepts, including test planning, test case design, and defect reporting. It demonstrates my foundational knowledge of software testing principles, methodologies, and quality assurance practices, providing concrete examples of how I apply theory to real-world scenarios.

## Skills Demonstrated
- Writing professional defect reports
- Creating test cases using black-box techniques
- Preparing a manual test plan
- Understanding and visualizing the Software Testing Life Cycle (STLC)
- Applying test design techniques: equivalence partitioning, boundary value analysis
- Performing risk-based and exploratory testing
