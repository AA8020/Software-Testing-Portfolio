## Overview
This folder contains practical applications of ISTQB® Foundation Level concepts for Day 1 of my Software Testing Portfolio.

## Skills Demonstrated
- Writing professional defect reports
- Creating test cases using black-box techniques
- Preparing a manual test plan
- Understanding and visualizing the Software Testing Life Cycle (STLC)
- Applying test design techniques: equivalence partitioning, boundary value analysis
- Performing risk-based and exploratory testing
