# 01 â€“ Foundation Testing

## ðŸ“Œ Overview  
This folder showcases **my hands-on practice** with **ISTQBÂ® Foundation Level** concepts, using real-world-style test artifacts and documentation.  
It reflects my ability to take theory and **apply it in a professional QA workflow**, covering everything from **manual test planning** to **defect reporting**.  

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Skills Iâ€™ve Practiced  
- Writing **clear, professional defect reports** with severity & priority  
- Designing **manual test plans** for a sample application  
- Creating **black-box test cases** with detailed steps, expected results, and pass/fail criteria  
- Applying core test design techniques:  
  - **Equivalence Partitioning (EP)**  
  - **Boundary Value Analysis (BVA)**  
- Understanding and visualizing:  
  - **Software Testing Life Cycle (STLC)**  
  - **Defect Life Cycle**  
- Performing **risk-based testing** to focus on the most critical areas  
- Conducting **exploratory testing** to uncover hidden issues

## ðŸ’¡ Why I Included This  
A strong foundation in software testing is key to producing high-quality products.  
By structuring my work in this way, Iâ€™m showing my ability to:  
- Understand and apply core QA concepts  
- Create professional test documentation  
- Use structured techniques to design effective tests  
- Communicate results clearly with the team
