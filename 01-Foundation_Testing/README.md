# 01 â€“ Foundation Testing

## ðŸ“Œ Overview
This folder demonstrates my understanding of planning and executing all major software testing types in sprints (days), using [demo.opencart.com](https://demo.opencart.com) as the real application under test. It covers the entire test cycle, from initial planning to exit criteria, with clear documentation and visual aids for recruiters.

## ðŸŽ¯ Knowledge Demonstrated
Here, I illustrate:
- How to structure sprints to cover all testing types: functional, non-functional, regression, integration, system, acceptance, exploratory, and more
- Progression through the Software Testing Life Cycle (STLC) using real demo site scenarios
- Planning, execution, and reporting for each test type
- Defining and meeting exit criteria for each sprint
