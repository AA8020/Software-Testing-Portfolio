# 01 â€“ Foundation Testing


## ðŸ“Œ Overview
This folder demonstrates my practical understanding of **ISTQBÂ® Foundation Level** concepts, using the OpenCart demo website (https://demo.opencart.com/) as a real-world example. It includes manual test planning, test case design, defect reporting, and coverage of core black-box and white-box techniques. All documentation and artifacts are structured to reflect professional QA workflows and industry standards.




## ðŸŽ¯ Knowledge Demonstrated
This section demonstrates:
- Reviewing requirements for clarity, completeness, and testability
- Peer reviewing test cases for coverage and accuracy
- Conducting smoke and sanity tests to validate build stability and critical fixes
- Performing integration, system, and user acceptance testing (UAT) for end-to-end coverage
- Executing regression and confirmation (re-testing) to ensure fixes and prevent defect recurrence
- Applying ad-hoc, exploratory, and error guessing techniques to uncover hidden issues
- Using checklist-based testing for consistent coverage of key areas
- Assessing usability, accessibility, and compatibility across devices, browsers, and OS
- Validating localization and internationalization for global readiness
- Observing performance under manual load conditions
- Reviewing UI/design for consistency, accessibility, and responsiveness
## ðŸ“Œ How to Navigate This Folder
Start with the [end_to_end_real_world_test.md](end_to_end_real_world_test.md) for a holistic demonstration of all test types applied to the OpenCart demo website.
Then, review each test type file in sequential QA workflow order:
1. Requirements Review
2. Test Case Review
3. Equivalence Partitioning & Boundary Value Analysis
4. Smoke & Sanity Testing
5. Integration Testing
6. System Testing
7. User Acceptance Testing (UAT)
8. Regression & Confirmation Testing
9. Ad-hoc, Exploratory, Error Guessing, Checklist-Based Testing
10. Usability, Accessibility, Compatibility, Localization, Internationalization, Performance, UI/Design Review

Each file contains real-world scenarios and results, demonstrating my ability to apply core manual test types in practice, supported by clear, professional documentation and industry-style examples.
