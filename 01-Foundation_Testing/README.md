# 01 â€“ Foundation Testing

## ðŸ“Œ Overview
This folder demonstrates my understanding of planning and executing all major software testing types manually in sprints (days), using [demo.opencart.com](https://demo.opencart.com) as the real application under test. It covers the entire test cycle, from initial planning to exit criteria, with clear documentation and visual aids for recruiters.

---
## ðŸŽ¯ Knowledge Demonstrated
Here, I illustrate:
- How to structure sprints to cover all testing types: functional, non-functional, regression, integration, system, acceptance, exploratory, and more
- Progression through the Software Testing Life Cycle (STLC) using real demo site scenarios
- Planning, execution, and reporting for each test type
- Defining and meeting exit criteria for each sprint

## ðŸ§­ How to Navigate This Folder
Each file is organized by day and test type. Start with Day 1 for planning and follow the sequence to see the full QA process applied to demo.opencart.com:

- Begin with [day1_test_planning.md](./day1_test_planning.md) for initial planning and requirements
- Continue through each dayâ€™s file for design, environment setup, and all major test types
- Review [day10_reporting.md](./day10_reporting.md) for the final summary and exit criteria

Visual diagrams and defect lifecycle explanations are also included for reference.
