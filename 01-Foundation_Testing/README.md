# 01 â€“ Foundation Testing


## ðŸ“Œ Overview
This folder is a demonstration of my knowledge of **ISTQBÂ® Foundation Level** concepts, presented through real-world-style test artifacts and documentation. Here, I illustrate how foundational testing theory is translated into professional QA workflows, including manual test planning and defect reporting.

## ðŸŽ¯ Knowledge Demonstrated
This section demonstrates:
- How to write clear, professional defect reports with severity and priority
- The process of designing manual test plans for sample applications
- The creation of black-box test cases with detailed steps, expected results, and pass/fail criteria
- Application of core test design techniques:
  - Equivalence Partitioning (EP)
  - Boundary Value Analysis (BVA)
- Understanding and visualization of:
  - Software Testing Life Cycle (STLC)
  - Defect Life Cycle
- Approaches for risk-based testing to focus on critical areas
- Methods for conducting exploratory testing to uncover hidden issues

## ðŸ’¡ Why I Included This
A strong foundation in software testing is essential for delivering reliable, high-quality products. This folder is structured to demonstrate my understanding of:

- Applying ISTQBÂ® Foundation Level concepts in real-world scenarios
- Creating clear, professional test documentation for team collaboration
- Designing effective test cases using industry-recognized techniques
- Identifying, reporting, and tracking defects with attention to severity, priority, and impact
- Prioritizing testing through risk-based analysis to maximize value and coverage
- Communicating findings clearly to both technical and non-technical stakeholders
