# Web Element Locators for Test Automation

## ðŸ“Œ Overview  
This folder demonstrates my skills in **identifying and interacting with web elements** for automated testing.  
It covers core locator strategies used in Selenium, Playwright, and other web automation tools, with practical examples for handling both static and dynamic elements.

---

## ðŸ’¡ Why I Included This  
Locating elements accurately is **crucial for reliable automation**:  
1. Ensure scripts interact with the correct UI elements  
2. Handle dynamic and complex page structures  
3. Reduce flakiness and maintenance overhead in automation frameworks  

This folder shows that I can **craft robust locators** and apply best practices for automation stability.

## ðŸŽ¯ Knowledge Demonstrated  
- Locating elements by **ID, name, class, CSS selectors, and XPath**  
- Handling **dynamic or changing elements**  
- Using **relative and absolute XPath** for complex DOM structures  
- Integrating locators into reusable methods and Page Object Models  

---

## ðŸ“Œ How to Navigate  

### 1. By ID & Name (`/01-By_ID_Name`)  
- **Focus**: Basic and most reliable locators  
- **What you will find**:  
  - Examples using `driver.findElement(By.id())` and `By.name()`  
  - Simple form interactions and validations  

### 2. CSS Selectors (`/02-CSS_Selectors`)  
- **Focus**: Flexible locator strategies for complex styling  
- **What you will find**:  
  - Element selection using classes, attributes, and hierarchy  
  - Combining CSS selectors for dynamic elements  

### 3. XPath (`/03-XPath`)  
- **Focus**: Navigating complex DOM trees  
- **What you will find**:  
  - Absolute vs relative XPath examples  
  - Using functions (`contains`, `starts-with`, `text()`) for dynamic elements  

### 4. Dynamic Elements (`/04-Dynamic_Elements`)  
- **Focus**: Handling elements that change on runtime  
- **What you will find**:  
  - Wait strategies combined with locators  
  - Examples of dynamic IDs, AJAX-loaded elements, and lists
