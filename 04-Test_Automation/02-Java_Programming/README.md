# Java Programming for Test Automation

## ðŸ“Œ Overview  
This folder demonstrates my foundational programming skills in **Java**, focused on **test automation applications**.  
It includes exercises, reusable scripts, and examples showing how Java integrates with automation tools like Selenium and TestNG.

---

## ðŸ’¡ Why I Included This  
Strong programming skills are essential for automation testers:  
1. Create **reusable and maintainable test scripts**  
2. Implement **logic, loops, and conditionals** to handle complex test flows  
3. Apply **OOP principles** to structure automation frameworks efficiently  

This folder shows that I can **write, organize, and integrate Java code** for practical test automation scenarios.

## ðŸŽ¯ Knowledge Demonstrated  
- Java syntax: variables, loops, conditionals, methods  
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP): classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism  
- Exception handling and debugging for reliable scripts  
- Integration with **Selenium WebDriver** and **TestNG**
