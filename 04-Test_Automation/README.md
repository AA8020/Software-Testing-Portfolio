# 04-Test_Automation

## üìå Overview  
This project demonstrates my ability to design, implement, and document **test automation frameworks** using a mix of code-based and codeless tools.  

Instead of leaving only raw scripts and configuration files, I‚Äôve included **well-documented examples, structured frameworks, and clear instructions**, making it easy for technical and non-technical readers to see how I automate tests, structure frameworks, and produce maintainable solutions.  

---

## üí° Why I Included This  
Automation is essential for modern QA teams, so testers must be able to:  
1. Build scalable, maintainable, and reusable automated test scripts  
2. Combine programming, database, and framework knowledge to test end-to-end scenarios  
3. Integrate automation with CI/CD pipelines and reporting to deliver actionable results  

This repository shows that I can implement **professional-grade automation frameworks** using industry-standard tools and practices.

## üéØ Knowledge Demonstrated  

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Programming & Database Foundations
- **Java for Automation:** Developed reusable scripts using loops, conditionals, methods, and OOP principles.  
- **SQL for Testers (Intermediate):** Verified database entries, performed data setup and cleanup, integrated SQL checks into automation scripts.  

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Core Automation Tools
- **Selenium WebDriver:** Automated web workflows across multiple browsers; implemented **Page Object Model (POM)** for maintainable scripts.  
- **Browser Locators:** Crafted reliable locators using ID, name, CSS selectors, and XPath; handled dynamic elements effectively.  

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Test Management & Frameworks
- **TestNG:** Structured test suites using annotations, data providers, and priorities; executed parallel tests and generated detailed reports.  
- **Codeless Automation (Selenium IDE):** Created quick smoke and regression tests without coding, exported scripts for integration with code-based frameworks.  

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Intermediate Automation Tools
- **Katalon Studio:** Built keyword-driven tests, reusable components, and custom keywords; integrated automation with CI/CD pipelines.  

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Advanced Automation Frameworks
- **Playwright (Advanced):** Developed cross-browser, end-to-end automated tests; handled dynamic pages, API requests, and parallel execution; integrated with CI/CD pipelines and dashboards.
