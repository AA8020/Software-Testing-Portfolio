# SQL for Test Automation

## ðŸ“Œ Overview  
This folder demonstrates my ability to use **SQL** for **database validation and automation testing**.  
It includes examples of queries for verifying test results, setting up and cleaning test data, and integrating database checks into automated scripts.

---

## ðŸ’¡ Why I Included This  
Database validation is essential for **end-to-end testing**:  
1. Ensure that **UI actions correctly update backend data**  
2. Validate **data integrity and consistency** after automated tests  
3. Automate data setup, cleanup, and verification for repeatable tests  

This folder shows that I can **use SQL effectively in automation** to verify application behavior beyond the UI.

## ðŸŽ¯ Knowledge Demonstrated  
- Basic SQL operations: `SELECT`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`  
- Filtering and sorting: `WHERE`, `ORDER BY`, `LIMIT`  
- Joining tables: `INNER JOIN`, `LEFT JOIN`  
- Aggregations: `COUNT`, `SUM`, `AVG`, `GROUP BY`  
- Integrating SQL queries into automation scripts for **verification and data setup**

## ðŸ“Œ How to Navigate  

### 1. Basic Queries (`/01-Basic_Queries`)  
- **Focus**: Fundamental SQL operations  
- **What you will find**:  
  - Examples of `SELECT`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`  
  - Queries to retrieve and manipulate test data  

### 2. Advanced Queries (`/02-Advanced_Queries`)  
- **Focus**: Joins, aggregations, and filters  
- **What you will find**:  
  - Combining multiple tables for end-to-end validation  
  - Aggregation queries to verify counts, sums, and averages  

### 3. Integration with Automation (`/03-Automation_Integration`)  
- **Focus**: Using SQL in automated tests  
- **What you will find**:  
  - Scripts verifying database updates after Selenium or Katalon test runs  
  - Examples of data setup and cleanup before and after tests  

### 4. Sample Test Cases (`/04-Sample_Test_Cases`)  
- **Focus**: Applying SQL in real test scenarios  
- **What you will find**:  
  - End-to-end scenarios combining UI actions with database validation  
  - Screenshots and sample outputs

## ðŸ›  Tools I Used  
- [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/) / [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) for database testing  
- [SQL Server](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/sql-server/) (optional) for additional practice  
- [Java](https://www.java.com/) for integrating queries into automated tests  
- [Selenium WebDriver](https://www.selenium.dev/) or [Katalon Studio](https://www.katalon.com/) for end-to-end automation
