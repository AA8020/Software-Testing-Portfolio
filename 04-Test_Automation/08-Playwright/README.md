# Playwright â€“  Test Automation

## ðŸ“Œ Overview  
This folder demonstrates my ability to use **Playwright** for **end-to-end automation**.  
It includes examples of cross-browser testing, handling dynamic web pages, API requests, parallel execution, and CI/CD integration.

---

## ðŸ’¡ Why I Included This  
Playwright is essential for **modern, reliable automation**:  
1. Automate web applications across **multiple browsers**  
2. Handle **dynamic pages, AJAX calls, and API interactions**  
3. Execute tests in **parallel** for efficiency  
4. Integrate with **CI/CD pipelines** and dashboards for continuous feedback  

This folder shows that I can **build professional-grade Playwright frameworks** and implement advanced automation practices.

## ðŸŽ¯ Knowledge Demonstrated  
- Cross-browser testing: Chromium, Firefox, and WebKit  
- Handling dynamic pages and locators: `waitForSelector`, `page.locator()`  
- API testing within Playwright scripts  
- Parallel test execution for speed  
- Integration with CI/CD pipelines and dashboards  
- Page Object Model (POM) and reusable helper functions

- **What you will find**:  
  - Parallel test scripts using Playwright Test Runner  
  - Integration with Jenkins or GitHub Actions  
  - Structured reporting and dashboard examples  

### 5. Page Object Model (`/05-POM`)  
- **Focus**: Reusable framework structure  
- **What you will find**:  
  - POM implementation for maintainable scripts  
  - Reusable helper functions for common actions

## ðŸ›  Tools I Used  
- [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/) for  cross-browser automation  
- [JavaScript/TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) for scripting  
- [Jest / Playwright Test Runner](https://playwright.dev/docs/test-intro) for test management  
- CI/CD tools (e.g., [Jenkins](https://www.jenkins.io/), GitHub Actions) for automated execution  
- Page Object Model for maintainable framework structure
