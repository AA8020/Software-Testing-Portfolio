# 03 â€“ API Testing with Postman  

## ðŸ“Œ Overview  
This folder demonstrates **API testing** using two widely-used public mock APIs:  
- **[JSONPlaceholder](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/)** â†’ CRUD operations (posts, comments, users, todos)  
- **[Reqres](https://reqres.in/)** â†’ Authentication, login, register, and error handling  

It also covers **API Security concepts** such as **Authorization & Authentication**, and showcases **automation with Newman** to generate shareable reports.  

---

## ðŸ’¡ Why I Included This  
This section highlights my ability to:  
- Test CRUD operations on backend APIs  
- Validate authentication and login flows  
- Apply API security testing (valid, invalid, and expired tokens)  
- Use data-driven testing with Postman  
- Automate runs and generate recruiter-friendly Newman reports

1. **CRUD API Testing** (JSONPlaceholder) â†’ [`JSONPlaceholder/`](./JSONPlaceholder/)  
   - Screenshots of CRUD test executions  
   - HTML and PDF reports from Newman  
   - Findings summary  

2. **Authentication & Security Testing** (Reqres) â†’ [`Reqres/`](./Reqres/)  
   - Login, register, and error handling scenarios  
   - Reports documenting pass and fail results  
   - Key findings and bug notes  

3. **API Security** â†’ [`Security/`](./Security/)  
   - Authorization and authentication test results  
   - Screenshots comparing valid, invalid, and expired tokens
