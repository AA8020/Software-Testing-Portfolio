# ðŸ“‚ API Testing with Postman  

## ðŸ“Œ Overview  
This project demonstrates my ability to design, execute, and document [API testing](https://www.postman.com/api-testing/) using [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) and [Newman](https://www.npmjs.com/package/newman).  
  

Instead of leaving only raw configs, Iâ€™ve included screenshots, clear reports, and well-documented findings. This makes it easy for both technical and non-technical readers to quickly see how I test, what I found, and how I present results.

## ðŸ’¡ Why I Included This  
Modern software relies heavily on APIs, so testers must:  
1. Validate API functionality beyond just the browser UI  
2. Ensure reliability and security by testing tokens, permissions, and error handling  
3. Detect bugs early and provide reproducible evidence through test reports  

This repository shows that I can test APIs effectively, analyze results, and communicate findings in a structured way.

## ðŸŽ¯ Knowledge Demonstrated  
1. CRUD Operations â€“ Validating Create, Read, Update, Delete endpoints  
2. Workflow Testing â€“ Combining endpoints to simulate real user flows  
3. Error Handling â€“ Checking system responses with invalid inputs and edge cases  
45. Reporting â€“ Generating detailed [HTML](https://www.npmjs.com/package/newman-reporter-htmlextra) and PDF reports with Newman

## ðŸ“Œ How to Navigate

### 1. [JSONPlaceholder](./JSONPlaceholder)  
- **Focus**: CRUD operations using the [JSONPlaceholder](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/) public API  
- **What you will find**:  
  - Screenshots of test runs (pass and fail)  
  - HTML and PDF reports generated by Newman  
  - A findings summary  

### 2. [Reqres](./Reqres)  
- **Focus**: User management and authentication scenarios using the [Reqres](https://reqres.in/) public API  
- **What you will find**:  
  - Screenshots showing both successful and error responses  
  - Execution reports in HTML and PDF format  
  - A findings summary

## ðŸ“‚ Key Artifacts in This Repository  

1. **Screenshots** â€“ Evidence of successful and failed test runs  
2. **Reports** â€“ Clear HTML and PDF reports generated with Newman  
3. **Collections** â€“ Postman collections used to run the tests  
4. **README.md files** â€“ Short documentation in each folder explaining what was tested and the main findings

## ðŸ›  Tools I Used  
- [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) for designing and running API tests  
- [Newman](https://www.npmjs.com/package/newman) for exporting test runs into shareable reports  
- [JSONPlaceholder](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/) as a public API for CRUD testing  
- [Reqres](https://reqres.in/) as a public API for authentication and user scenarios
