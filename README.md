# 🧪 Software Testing Portfolio

## 👤 WhoAmI 
An **ISTQB® CTFL v4 certified junior software tester** who’s focused on building a strong foundation in QA and constantly improving.  
I’ve worked hands-on with **manual testing, test automation, API testing, and CI/CD basics**, applying what I learn directly in real-world-style projects.  

This portfolio highlights **software testing in practice**. It’s organized to reflect my journey: beginning with **fundamentals**, then expanding into **tools, automation, performance, and DevOps practices**. Each section shows both the concepts I’ve studied and how I’ve applied them in projects.

## 🚀 Getting Started
To explore my portfolio:  
1. Browse the folders for each stage of my learning path  
2. Open the README.md inside for explanations, artifacts, and examples  
3. Check out scripts, test cases, and reports to see how I apply software testing in practice

## 💡 What I Bring to the Table
Although early in my software testing career, I bring:  
- A strong **manual testing foundation** (test design, bug reporting, planning)  
- The ability to **apply automation and API testing** in practical projects  
- Exposure to **performance and CI/CD testing practices**  
- A habit of **clear documentation** and structured reporting  

My focus is on growing into a **well-rounded software tester** who not only executes tests but also understands how testing supports the **whole development process**.
