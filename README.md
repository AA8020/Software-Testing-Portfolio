## 💡 What I Bring to the Table
I go beyond just running tests. I understand how **QA fits into the bigger picture** and use this perspective to ensure quality is built into every stage of development. Through **real-world projects, clear documentation, and a mix of manual testing, automation, and DevOps practices**, I can manage the full QA cycle from planning to execution, reporting, and closure while driving real impact in QA teams.
