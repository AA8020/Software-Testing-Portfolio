# 05-Performance_Testing

## ðŸ“Œ Overview
This project demonstrates **performance testing using Apache JMeter** on the [JSONPlaceholder API](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/).  
It highlights my ability to **design, execute, and analyze performance tests** while applying industry-standard QA practices.

The test plan simulates multiple users performing **GET and POST requests**, using **thread groups, controllers, timers, and assertions** to create realistic load scenarios.  
It measures **response times, throughput, utilization, and error handling**, providing a comprehensive understanding of system behavior under stress.

## ðŸ’¡ Why I Included This
This project is included to showcase that I can:  
- **Plan and execute performance tests** that reflect real-world usage  
- **Use JMeterâ€™s advanced features** like Loop, Runtime, Throughput, and Once Only Controllers  
- **Analyze key metrics** such as response times, throughput, and error rates to identify bottlenecks  
- **Document findings professionally**, demonstrating clear communication and QA best practices  
- Apply **robust testing techniques** suitable for enterprise-level QA workflows

## ðŸ’¡ Skills Demonstrated
- **Thread Groups and Controllers**: Loop Controller, Runtime Controller, Throughput Controller, Once Only Controller  
- **HTTP Requests**: GET and POST requests to API endpoints with JSON payloads  
- **Response Assertions**: Ensuring endpoints return expected status codes (200 / 201)  
- **Timers**: Simulating realistic user think time  
- **Listeners**: Summary Report, Aggregate Report, View Results Tree  
- **HTML Dashboard Report**: Generating interactive performance report with charts and tables  
- **Findings Documentation**: Recording observations and insights in Markdown
