# 05-Performance_Testing

## ðŸ“Œ Overview  
This folder showcases **performance testing using Apache JMeter and the BlazeMeter plugin** on the [JSONPlaceholder API](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/).  
It demonstrates how to design, record, and execute performance tests while measuring **response time, throughput, scalability, and system robustness**, emphasizing professional QA workflows and reporting.

## ðŸ’¡ Why I Included This  
This section shows that I can:  
- Simulate realistic user load using **Thread Groups** and multiple controllers  
- Record and replay API interactions with **BlazeMeter**  
- Capture performance metrics including **average/median response time, throughput, and errors**  
- Analyze and document **bottlenecks and system limits**  
- Apply QA principles in **performance and load testing**
